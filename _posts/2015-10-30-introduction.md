**_She doesn't need your GLASS Slipper...Help Her Break The Glass Ceiling:  _**Men, prepare your selves., will assist professional women as
well as large corporations and more importantly, inform male spouses of the
unavoidable conclusion that the shift in women breadwinners is here to stay and
that the numbers are predicted to continue to rise.**_What are Men Afraid of?'_** is what
every woman should know before or while married to a man who may be traditional
or not, however, she has the potential to be a corporate leader, now or in the
future. '**_What are Men Afraid of?'_**'First of all, we are not speaking of
man's fear to protect his wife or family in the physical sense, like a whip
etc. This book addresses the traditional and/or psychological make-up of a
majority of men, here in America and around the world.

This was the first time ever, that women have
surpassed men in professional occupations.The Bureau of Labor
Statistics indicates, as of November 2004, women represent 50.6 percent of the
48 million employees in management, professional and related occupations.As more women take
positions of leadership they are more likely to be targeted by their employers
for transfers.According to the 2000 U.S. Census, it
is reported that 2 million men have given up their careers to follow the career
path of their wives.

More specifically, the male
trailing partner who, as a result of a career opportunity for his wife or
"leading partner", relocates, (often 3 to 7 times), to another city, state or
country in support of her career.The goal of this book is to address the
concerns of those who find themselves in the position of a trailing
partner.

The author believes the information presented
in the form of a nonfiction narrative, a perspective highlighting real world
cases in which mistakes were made and remedies provided, will facilitate
discussion and understanding.These issues are magnified
when the male assumes the non-traditional role of trailing partner. Trailing partners
of company employees often resist relocation based on the notion of the
unknown, which adds stress to a relationship and often negatively impacts that
organization.It is critical that large and growing
companies have the best people strategically positioned to facilitate and
achieve company goals.

Issues that address: His discoveries will address
the concerns supported by research, statistics, case scenarios and expert
opinion.This book will draw attention to the
issues surrounding male trailing partners - husbands who follow the career path
of their wives. In Richard Watts' fifth-teen years as a trailing partner, he
has spoken to countless couples, some currently together and others not, on
this issue.

is also for those men and women, who find
ourselves in this position and may have asked, 'Wouldn't it have been a bit
easier to know that this set of circumstances were an option for our lives,
than to find ourselves in this position, without any experiences, or a plan to
move forward. 

. **_What
are Men Afraid of?'_**There was not any advice from mom,
grandmother, grandfather, father, or mentor regarding the steps to creating a
strong relationship and family posture with a male trailing partner until 'Not until now, has there been any
published research on this new evolutionary male role.
